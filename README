To use the python api wrapper copy the entire folder at /home/pi/HROS1-Framework/Linux/project/node_server/api_wrapper to /home/pi/HROS1-Framework/Linux/project/api_wrapper2/api_wrapper2. Then replace the main.cpp in that folder with my main.cpp and run make. Then you should be able to import the api.py module no matter where it is located and it should work. 

The test.py file shows how to use it. The api.py file must be in the same folder as the script you are running.
